## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Downloading and Installing

The GAS.COM app is available for both Android and iOS devices.
* **Android:** Download from the Google Play Store (search for "GAS.COM").
* **iOS:** Download from the Apple App Store (search for "GAS.COM").

Once downloaded, simply open the app to begin.

### 1.2 Initial Access: Authorization Required

Upon opening the app for the very first time, or after a complete re-installation, you will be greeted by an **"Authorization Required"** screen. This is the first step to ensure secure access to the app.

* You will see a field labeled **"Authorization Code"**.
* Enter one of the following codes depending on your user type:
    * **For Customers:** `gasU@25`
    * **For Administrators:** `gasA@25`
* Tap the **"Proceed"** button.

### 1.3 Logging In

After successfully entering an authorization code, you will proceed to the appropriate login screen:

#### For Customers: Personalized Login

If you entered the customer authorization code (`gasU@25`) and have previously set up your personal login credentials, you will be taken to the **"User Login"** screen.

* **Existing User Example Credentials:**
    * **Username:** `gasuser`
    * **Password:** `Gas@123`
    (Note: You would have set these up yourself after your very first order.)

* Enter your **Username** and **Password** in the respective fields.
* Tap the **"Login"** button.

If you are a first-time customer and have not yet set up a username and password, you will be taken directly to the main shop (`Home Screen`) after entering `gasU@25`. You will be prompted to set up your personalized username and password after your very first order is placed.

#### For Administrators: Admin Authentication

If you entered the admin authorization code (`gasA@25`), you will be directly logged into the Admin Dashboard.

Alternatively, if you are on the **"User Login"** screen, you can tap the **Admin Access icon** (looks like an admin panel or storefront icon, usually at the top right) in the App Bar to go to the **"Admin Authentication"** screen.

* On the **"Admin Authentication"** screen, enter the **Admin Password**.
    * **Admin Password:** `gasA@25`
* Tap **"Login as Admin"**.

If you enter an incorrect password on the Admin Authentication screen, you will see a pop-up message stating: "This page is for administrators only. Please use the user login page if you are not an admin." It will also include a **"Go to User Login"** button to take you back to the regular customer login screen.
